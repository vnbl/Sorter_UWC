# Sorter_UWC
 I made this to help out a friend who volunteers at UWC sort applicants into fair and random reviewing groups

 Currently the system gives 9 reviewers a list of 30 students out of 90 for review. Each student must be reviewed 3 times by members of the review board, and there shouldn't be the possibility of making "review groups" (meaning you can't give two reviewers the same list of students).
 
 The output is an .xlsx file with 9 columns and 30 rows called arrays.xlsx
 
 Plans 4 future: make a web app in which you can sort any number of applicants into any number of review groups.
